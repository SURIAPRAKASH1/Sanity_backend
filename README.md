# Sanity 

  Sanity.io is a platform that provides developers with a flexible and powerful content infrastructure. It's often referred to as a headless CMS (Content Management System) because it allows you to manage content separately from its presentation, enabling you to deliver content to various platforms and devices via APIs.

  So this sanity Api used for my portfolio to fetch data from it.
